**NOTE**: this was written against Julia 0.6 and did not have any tests, and has received only minor updates since.
It's likely that there are lurking bugs.

AllenBrain can query the *in situ* and projection databases of the [Allen Brain Atlas](https://portal.brain-map.org/).
It can also generate 3d visualizations colored by brain region using Makie.

AllenBrain was written to create the figures for the following paper, in which you can see some of the things this package can do. Please cite it if you find AllenBrain.jl useful:
